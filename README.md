# ⏳ Productivity Reminder – Stay Healthy While You Work! 🚀  
Latest Version: https://daily-productivity.vercel.app/
## 🌟 About  

During my internship as a **Software Engineer**, I realized how often we forget to take essential breaks—whether it's relaxing our eyes, stretching, or staying hydrated. These small habits significantly impact **productivity, health, and overall well-being**.  

Some may call breaks an excuse to avoid hard work, but ever since I built this **notification reminder**, I have consistently:  
✅ Drunk **2-3 liters of water daily**  
✅ Taken **10-12 short breaks** to relax my eyes, stretch, and refresh  
✅ Felt **more energetic and focused** throughout the day  

This tool ensures you **never forget** to take care of yourself while working!
